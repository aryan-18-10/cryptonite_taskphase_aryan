# PONDERING PATHS

Got to know what directories are and that / is the main directory then ran the program /pwn.
```
flag obtained: pwn.college{ItGXNHcpyxhyQKBXOP5VaCH2O4Z.dhzN5QDLyYTN0czW}
```

## CHALLENGE 2: Program and absolute paths
went to the directory /challemge then opened the file run inside it using its absolute path.
```
flag obtained: pwn.college{w-1meo6vFadnoZMfZzatTy4u_rb.dVDN1QDLyYTN0czW}
```

# CHALLENGE 3: Position thy self
got to know that this ~ symbolises the home directory and the cd function can be used to change directories to access different files and programs. Changed directory to the required one and ran /challenge/run and obtained the flag.
```
flag obtained: pwn.college{0UaLYEuw79rox7oSzOwQ43AQBR4.dZDN1QDLyYTN0czW}
```

# CHALLENGE 4: Position elsewhere
this challenge was similar to the previous one so it was easy and took no time. Almost seemed like a trick question.
```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{858dV5_2hzmB3i8Mo0mNqIeAM5e.ddDN1QDLyYTN0czW}
 ```

 # CHALLENGE 5: Position yet elsewhere
 again similar to the 3rd challenge was pretty easy.
 ```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{cPjlYnYEymdCKXU1UyxEtIFJgXa.dhDN1QDLyYTN0czW}

 # CHALLENGE 6: Implicit relative paths, from /
 this seemed easy to me as i had already learnt about relative paths earlier in school so this seemed kind of obvious.
 ```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{YKVL-Z4KYnev5MUky-KogLem3rC.dlDN1QDLyYTN0czW}
 ```
 ##


 # CHALLENGE 7: Explicit relative paths ,from /
 This was new to me and that . can represent the current directory. Understood it well and didnt know how much id end up using it. Found the flag pretty easily
 ```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{MRzWNOfOTtKYJYs4LDtP2Z62121.dBTN1QDLyYTN0czW}
 ```
 ##


 # CHALLENGE 8: Implicit relative path
 Got to know why the paths are mentioned before functions or programs are run. Used the relative path and ran the run functiona and obtained the flag.
 ```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{INzD3Bu0-gwIYDaSxZ_BQ8FTZa9.dFTN1QDLyYTN0czW}
 ```

 # CHALLENGE 9: Home sweet home
 already knew that ~ represents the /home/hacker as i found out while tinkering in a previous challenge. Took a second to undertsand the question but when i did it took no time to complete it. Ran the fucntion with the proper arguments and got the flag
 ```
 flag obtained: pwn.college{8d_psl3NMFjPpyRVTnQuTaw2Koo.dNzM4QDLyYTN0czW}
